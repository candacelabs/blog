## what am i looking at

this is a hugo blog theme inspired by the candaceserver ping service terminal aesthetic.

### how does this work?

the homepage mimics the terminal style from the main candaceserver page, while individual posts use the clean app-style interface like the pastebin and 007 services.

### available features:

- terminal-style homepage with green headings and cyan links
- clean app-style post layouts 
- responsive design
- ping service color scheme and typography
- back-to-terminal navigation

try clicking on a post to see the clean interface, then come back here for the terminal vibes!
